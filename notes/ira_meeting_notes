Meeting tuesday at 10 on review and morgan's project

meeting on thursday at 2 on probability paper
- frank and goodman 2012
- bergen and franke 2019



- ira eliciting prosody on irony task



____________________________________________
meeting 2/2

- negation alone?

show the whold first conjunct, then the connective, then the second conjunct

- mock up with the simpler 
- add the intro
- clean up list of conditions


think about the fillers (what other questions)
are there any vowels

conjunct-less answers (negation and no negation)



the cat from hell

-------------------------------------------------
til meeting
go with the chunking
(previewing the length of the chunks can fuck up the processing)


don't need to trust dana
helping out fox 
make it part of the game that fox figures out whether dana is lying?

fromt he participant's perspective, what would they need?>

cloze task shows the expectancy of 'but' 
2-alternative forced  choice
- also show's a within-item predictor

- cloze will be modulated by QUD
Does cloze predict the reading time?





_______________________________-
remove the clicking from all the trials, keep it just for training



moving more toward entropy reduction

towards plugging into a computational model
what counts as a gain in information

_______________________________
Meeting 10/3
- More information at the beginning
- make it really friendly
- more specific about the game: whether or not each character can see the letters. make it more clear
- spacebar for next slide as well
- remove some of the extra buttons
- reveal the dialogues with space bar presses
- Minimize the keys
- space bar to next slide

- keep the target on the page during judgement task

-

meeting 1/4/22

"yes and there is no z"
"yes but there's also a z"

technical issue:
a versus an issue article

line 19 of the excel file


double click


_______________________________
meeting 4/4/22

balance more
have all four cases of QUDLettersMatch!
(at very least to create more fillers)

- and the yn is a control to the ny, that there's something about havin the 'but' there that 


make sure that the conjuncts line up!

No lying answerer cases!


fillers shouldn't only be single letter 

XX Did X give a truthful answer?



EEG thoughts:
what if
a but b
how surprising is ~c? (c= usually a and not b)

comparison between letters and meaningful conjuncts? (re discussion in bonneford et all 2009?)


thoughts on computational model of relevance:

based on wilson (2016) p8 top:
- maybe interpretation has to reach some threshold 
- the interpretation chosen has to meet a threshold

i would think that frequency be really important here
because frequency will in the end contribute to making an inference easier to process

__________________________________________

Honest mistake false item fillers?

PLAYERS ARE CHILDREN AND SOMETIMES THEY GET THINGS WRONG

fillers: add true 'yes' and 'no' polar answers (make half true and half false)
add 12 more incorrect ones
half correct, half incorrect
corect ones are yes / no
'and' and 'or' QUDs + conjunct answers
q

- was dana's response correct?
yes or no




__________________________________________
instructions about the dependent measure


is it a good answer versus?




so maybe facilitation at end of second conjunction


make the instuctions clearer about 
given the question asked, did dana



keep the target sentence on the screen?? 

****Decide wehther F gave a good answer to D's question?

****removing the conjunctive fillers!!!

lab meeting practice talks for ELM 11/5


Cecile:
- description of experiment 1: you're burrying the point about the minimalism in the experiment, presupposing the negative

- experiment 2 was faster in general, what does that mean?


Morgan:
- take the embedding out

- characterizing the relation of answer to question

- change the beginning example



TODO
1. send ira link to conn/QUD experiment with changes
- depent measure
- intro

2. get the consent from the oslo (in kira's study)
ask from camillo



______________________________________________________________________
- is the time clicking through the contexts very fast?
- do all the filters




____________________________________________________________
EEG

idling theory

thoughts

9/10 and 7/8

Overall, is there an interaction between QUD and connective on reading time?
---> it seems that there is...
'but' seems to be read slower in the general QUD than 'and', than it is in the specific QUD

--> make a graph with QUD and connective and RT on axis


____________________________________
06-22 meeting

Post final and third pilot

check out total times for but versus and, are they compqrable ?


look at density plots for each item to look for possible bimodal distribution on #s9/10


work on the OSF


draw out the table of factors
2x2x3

connective x negation x qud

negation x first-conj-relevant


digig deeper cases
1,2,11,12


EXPERIMENT 1
reducing to 3-10 in experiment 1
QUDLetters x conj x negation

reduce 1/2 and 11/12 to single filler items
(remove second occurrence)

EXPERIMENT 2
introduce 1/2, 11/12


TO DO
- look at the item differences for 7/8 and 1/2....why in the General QUD case are 7/8 faster than 1/2? they are structurally the same
