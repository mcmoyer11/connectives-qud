Are you interested in taking part in the research project
COMPREHENSION?

This study is interested in the way people make decisions. In this letter we will give you information
about the purpose of the project and what your participation will involve.

Purpose of the project
This project investigates people’s reactions to presented abstract problems.

Who is responsible for the research project?

Camille Louis Alexandre Berger, student at Ecole Normale Supérieure.

Ira Noveck, Directeur de Recherche, CNRS

Why are you being asked to participate?
We want to understand how people come to conclusions when shown instructions. We’re looking for native speakers of English.

What does participation involve?
You will sit in front of the computer and we will ask you to read short problems and ask you to give an answer you think is correct. The experiment should last between 5 and 7 minutes. Your Prolific ID
will be required at the start of the experiment. The completion URL for payment will be provided at the end of the experiment. You have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at
any time. However, please note that in order to validate the experiment you need to complete the experiment and click the link you get at the end. Otherwise we have no way to process your payment.

Your job will be to provide answers, either through multiple choice or short answers.

Your personal privacy – how we will store and use your personal data
We will only use your personal data for the purpose(s) specified in this information letter. We will process your personal data confidentially and in accordance with data protection legislation (the
General Data Protection Regulation and Personal Data Act).
The data collected by this experiment is saved on a server of the Université de Paris after data collection is completed. Data that is stored on the server of the Université de Paris is anonymized and
password-protected. They are not stored together with information that could help to relate the data to
individual test subjects.
Only Camille Berger, Ira Noveck and their associates have access to the anonymized data.
Camille Berger, Ira Noveck and their associates have no access to the personal data collected by
Prolific, and no data collected in this experiment can be traced back to a specific person, since the
online platform does not give out participants’ private information. However, Prolific collects
personal data such as IP address, or the date and time that our experiments were called up, in
accordance with their terms and conditions. Prolific has no access to the experimental data that we
collect. You have already agreed that Prolific collects some personal data when you have signed your
contract with Prolific. Further information can be found in the data protection regulations of Prolific.
Camille Berger and Ira Noveck are not responsible for contractual arrangements that are agreed
between the test persons and Prolific regarding the processing of personal data. Access to the
research data collected at the chair is restricted to Camille Berger and Ira Noveck. All employees
involved have been obliged to fulfil their duty of confidentiality conscientiously. The data is processed
exclusively on the server of Université de Paris. The data will only be passed on by the researchers to
third parties (such as scientific journals) in a completely anonymous, pre-processed form.
Publications only take place with anonymous, averaged data that is untraceable in any way or form to
individual participants in the study.
What will happen to your personal data at the end of the research project?
The project is scheduled to end in 2022. After the end of the project, all data will remain stored in the
password-protected servers of Université de Paris in fully anonymized form.
Your rights
So long as you can be identified in the collected data, you have the right to:
- access the personal data that is being processed about you
- request that your personal data is deleted
- request that incorrect personal data about you is corrected/rectified
- receive a copy of your personal data (data portability), and
- send a complaint to the responsible for data protection or CNIL (Commission Nationale
Informatique et Liberté), the French authority on data protection, regarding the processing of
your personal data
What gives us the right to process your personal data?
We will process your personal data based on your consent.
Based on an agreement with Université de Paris and the CNIL, Doriane Gras has assessed that the
processing of personal data in this project is in accordance with data protection legislation.
